Each file in this dir is a minimal self-contained working applications (Sinatra/Rails) that you can just run on your computer without any external configuration.

The only requirement is ruby 2.5+ installed in your environment.

If you need a full featured Rails app with different ready to use configurations,
please take a look at the [Pagy Rails App]
(https://github.com/benkoshy/pagy-rails).
